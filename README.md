# Replication 3
Replication of The Political Legacy of American Slavery by Avidit Acharya, Matthew Blackwell and Maya Sen.

Please run compressing.R upon initial run in order to extract the data files necessary for this replication. Ensure that you are running zip 2.0 for this process to run. If you are currently operating with zip 1.0 this can be done by running update.packages() in the console and entering y (yes) when prompted for the zip library. It is not necessary to update other packages.

After extracting the necessary data files, you can run replication3.Rmd which should result in the output of replication figures which currently consist of a completed Figure 1, 4, 5 and Table 1, 3, 6.
